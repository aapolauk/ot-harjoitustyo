No terve. Ai, että kun on mukavaa täällä OT kurssilla.

Ois voinu tehä nää hieman aikaisemmin.


In mathematics, more specifically in the study of dynamical systems and differential equations, a Liénard equation[1] is a second order differential equation, named after the French physicist Alfred-Marie Liénard.

During the development of radio and vacuum tube technology, Liénard equations were intensely studied as they can be used to model oscillating circuits. Under certain additional assumptions Liénard's theorem guarantees the uniqueness and existence of a limit cycle for such a system.

Definition

Let f and g be two continuously differentiable functions on R, with g an odd function and f an even function. Then the second order ordinary differential equation of the form

    d 2 x d t 2 + f ( x ) d x d t + g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle {d^{2}x \over dt^{2}}+f(x){dx \over dt}+g(x)=0} {d^{2}x \over dt^{2}}+f(x){dx \over dt}+g(x)=0

is called the Liénard equation.
Liénard system

The equation can be transformed into an equivalent two-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. We define

    F ( x ) := ∫ 0 x f ( ξ ) d ξ {\displaystyle F(x):=\int _{0}^{x}f(\xi )d\xi } F(x):=\int _{0}^{x}f(\xi )d\xi 
    x 1 := x {\displaystyle x_{1}:=x} {\displaystyle x_{1}:=x}
    x 2 := d x d t + F ( x ) {\displaystyle x_{2}:={dx \over dt}+F(x)} x_{2}:={dx \over dt}+F(x)

then

    [ x ˙ 1 x ˙ 2 ] = h ( x 1 , x 2 ) := [ x 2 − F ( x 1 ) − g ( x 1 ) ] {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}{\dot {x}}_{1}\\{\dot {x}}_{2}\end{bmatrix}}=\mathbf {h} (x_{1},x_{2}):={\begin{bmatrix}x_{2}-F(x_{1})\\-g(x_{1})\end{bmatrix}}} {\begin{bmatrix}{\dot {x}}_{1}\\{\dot {x}}_{2}\end{bmatrix}}={\mathbf {h}}(x_{1},x_{2}):={\begin{bmatrix}x_{2}-F(x_{1})\\-g(x_{1})\end{bmatrix}}

is called a Liénard system.

Alternatively, since Liénard equation itself is also an autonomous differential equation, the substitution v = d x d t {\displaystyle v={dx \over dt}} v={dx \over dt} leads the Liénard equation to become a first order differential equation:

    v d v d x + f ( x ) v + g ( x ) = 0 {\displaystyle v{dv \over dx}+f(x)v+g(x)=0} v{dv \over dx}+f(x)v+g(x)=0

which belongs to Abel equation of the second kind.[2][3]
